    <p class="color1 para1">
        Maharashtra is a state in the western and central peninsular region of India occupying a substantial portion of the Deccan Plateau.
         The centre of India is in this state.
         Maharashtra is the second-most populous state in India as well as the third-most populous country subdivision in the world. <br></p>
        <p class="color1 para1">
            Maharashtra occupies the western and central part of the country and has a long coastline stretching 
            720 kilometres along the Arabian Sea.One of the more prominent physical features of Maharashtra is the Deccan plateau, 
            which is separated from the Konkan coastline by 'Ghats'.[59] The Ghats are a succession of steep hills, periodically 
            bisected by narrow roads. </p>
        <p class="color1 para1">
            Most of the famous hill stations of the state are at the Ghats. The Western Ghats (or the Sahyadri Mountain range) 
            provide a physical backbone to the state on the west, while the Satpura Hills along the north and Bhamragad-Chiroli-Gaikhuri ranges 
            on the east serve as its natural borders.[60] The state is surrounded by Gujarat to the north west, Madhya Pradesh to the north, 
            Chhattisgarh to the east, Telangana to the south east, 
            Karnataka to the south and Goa to the south west</p>
        <p class="color1 para1">
            Flora of Maharashtra is heterogeneous in composition. In 2012 the recorded thick forest area in the state was 61,939 km2 (23,915 sq mi) 
            which was about 20.13%.

    <h3>
    <p class="color1 para2">
        Traditional clothes for Maharashtrian males include the dhoti, also known as Dhotar, and pheta, 
        while a choli and nine-yard saree locally known as Nauwari saadi or Lugda is for women. 
        Traditional clothing is famous in rural areas while traditional people from cities also wear these clothing. 
        These clothes are worn by Maharashtrians while performing various festivals <br></p>
        <p class="color1 para2">
            <span style="color:#ff0077"> Women dressing style:</span><br>
            Women wear sarees that are 9 yards long. The saree is tucked in the middle giving it a similar 
            look to the dhoti. The rest of the saree is wrapped around the upper body of the women. 
            This type of saree is usually called Lugade. There were many variations in how women wear their saree. 
            Some only wear knee length sarees. Some wear it in a skirt manner without the tuck in the middle. 
            But the 9-yard saree is the traditional costume of women in Maharashtra.
            Women wear nath i.e. a nose piercing. The commonly found colours in Maharashtrian sarees are green and red.
            Women do not have a separate headwear as the men do. They simply use the end of their sarees to cover their heads.</p>
        <p class="color1 para2">
            <span style="color:#0011ff"> Traditional costumes style of Men:</span><br>
            The men in Maharashtra usually we a dhoti. A dhoti is a single piece of cloth 
            that is tucked around one's waist, and it covers the entire leg till the ankle.
             Dhotis are secured by making five tucks on each side, and then the loose ends are put in at the back. 
             Dhotis are usually saffron or cream or white in colour. Dhotis are an unstitched piece of clothing that do 
             not require any proper measurements 
            as one could make it however tight or loose they wished it to be.</p>
        <p class="color1 para2">
            Maharashtrians usually have the same style for everything - work or celebration. Therefore their clothes were made comfortable.
